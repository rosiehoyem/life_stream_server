# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
rosie_user = User.create(first_name: "Rosie", last_name: "Hoyem", email: "rosiehoyem@gmail.com", password: "Password1!", password_confirmation: "Password1!")
admim_user = User.create(first_name: "Admin", last_name: "User", email: "rosiehoyem@gmail.com", password: "Password1!", password_confirmation: "Password1!")
